# CPP7days
This repository is for the purpose of all the codes that have been generated during the training period involving C/C++.

## Case - study:
  
`ofstream : Stream class to write on files.`

`ifstream : Stream class to read from files.`

`fstream : Stream class to both read and write from/to files.`

**Case 1:** Implement grep functionality in Visual Studio using C++ (file-handling),
        along with debug_statements, unit testing and all error-checking covered.
	
**Case 2:** Read JSON and create Graph.

**Case 3:** Write Graph algorithms.

**Case 4:** Write deviation from regular.


### Team member tasks:
 - Code: parser to read from a file and can generate tokens.
 - Code: all comparison functionalities which return bool.
 - Code: all unit-test-cases for testing all kinds of functions.
 - Code: To write output, debug separately.
 Leader - Design: Data-structures/ Schema, Workflow (flow-chart, Psudocode, etc), 
	Design, input file formats, output file formats, Re-usability,
	Patterns to be or is used.
 
 ### Evaluation:
 1. Coding standards, Naming standards (Camel-case is preferable)
 2. Psudocode
 3. Comments (Along with source urls)
 4. Logic
 5. Input - Output
 6. Error handling
 7. Unit test-cases ( along with debugging)
 8. Integration. 
 9. Version control or check-in process followed.

```
For example,
 /*
	Name: fn_compare or funcCompare
	Input Args:
	Output Args:
	Return:
	Description / Pseucode:
	 ----	
	Author:
 */
 bool fn_compare(inputFile, inputString){
 /*
 - Within this function:
 	- Debugging/ Logfile
 	- Actual code
 - Within and Outside
 	- error handling
 - Outside
 	- Unit test-cases
*/
 }
 ```
